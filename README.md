# Artificial-Intel-Sentiment--HW

- Sentiment Analysis is a Big Data problem which seeks to determine the general attitude of a writer given some text they have written. For instance, we would like to have a program that could look at the text “The film was a breath of fresh air” and realize that it is a positive statement while “It made me want to poke out my eye balls” is negative. 
- One algorithm that we can use for this is to assign a numeric value to any given word based on how positive or negative that word is and then score the statement based on the values of the words. But, how do we come up with our word scores in the first place?
- That’s the problem that we’ll solve in this assignment. You’ll use training.txt to learn which words are positive and which are negative.
- The file displayed below contains two pieces of data on each line: the positivity rating and the sentence it is for. 

$1 You could hate it for the same reason .
$4 The performances are an absolute joy .
$3 I still like Moonlight Mile , better judgment be damned .
$3 a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it
$1 As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .
$2 It 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more .
$4 Best indie of the year , so far .
$1 It 's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend .
