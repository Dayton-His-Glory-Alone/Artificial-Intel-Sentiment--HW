    "# Sentiment Analysis is a Big Data problem which seeks to determine the general attitude of a writer given some text they have written. For instance, we would like to have a program that could look at the text “The film was a breath of fresh air” and realize that it is a positive statement while “It made me want to poke out my eye balls” is negative. \n",

    "# As soon as the user enters in a learning data file name (i.e., training.txt) your program should read in all of this file’s data. You may assume it is in the format described above. Using this data you should create a dictionary that contains each word mapped to the sum of the scores for each line that the word occurred in divided by the total number of times it occurred. For example, if the file contained only the following four lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1 it wasn’t the best\n",

    "# 4 oh wow it was so great!!!! The BEST!\n",

    "# Note that this ignores capitalization and punctuation. You must get rid of all characters that aren’t letters or numbers. We suggest that you use the ord function to do this.

(Refer to https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html?highlight=ord#ord for ord() function.)\n",
    "# It will be easiest to keep track of the necessary data if you keep track of data in two dictionaries, one with a count of the times you see each word and one with the sum of the scores for each word.

    "# Computing the average score\n",
    "# To get the average score for words in a new user provided file (that has a sentence – see the given example.txt), first read in that file, normalize the case and strip it of all punctuation, as described above, and split it on whitespace. Then, compute the average of the scores for all words in the file. Output this to the user and output whether it is generally positive or negative. You can consider an average score above 2.01 as positive and one below 1.99 as negative. Anything in between should be considered neutral. \n",
    "# After the program outputs this data it should ask the user if it identified the sentiment correctly. If the user types “yes” it should do nothing. If the user types “no” it should prompt the user for the correct score and add that, for the words in the sentence, to the dictionaries. \n",
    "# Highest / Lowest scores\n",
    "# If the user asks for the highest / lowest scoring words you should do the same thing as above except output the highest and lowest scoring words of all words in the file. You may assume that there is at least one word in the file. \n",

    "# Style Guidelines:\n",
    "# No specific constants are required for this assignment, but you should use them anywhere they will help make your code clearer\n",
    "# We will grade your function structure strictly on this assignment.  Use at least five nontrivial functions besides main.  \n",
    "# These functions should use parameters and returns, including dictionaries, as appropriate.  \n",
    "# The functions should be well-structured and avoid redundancy.  \n",
    "# No one function should do too large a share of the overall task.  \n",
    "# You may not nest these functions inside each other or in main.\n",
    "# Your main function should be a concise summary of the overall program.  \n",
    "# It is okay for main to contain some code but main \n",
    "# should not perform too large a share of the overall work itself, \n",
    "# such as traversing over dictionaries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Also avoid \"chaining,\" when many functions call each other without ever returning to main.\n",
    "# We will check strictly for redundancy on this assignment.  \n",
    "# If you have a very similar piece of code that is repeated several times in your program, eliminate the redundancy such as by creating a function, by using for loops over the elements of lists and/or dictionaries, and/or by factoring if/else code.\n",
    "# Since dictionaries are a key component of this assignment, \n",
    "# part of your grade comes from using lists and dictionaries properly.  \n",
    "# Carefully consider how they should be passed as parameters and/or returned from functions \n",
    "# as you are decomposing your program.  \n",
    "# You may not have any global variables (except constants) or code outside of functions.\n"
